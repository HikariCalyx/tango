# tango-dataview

tango-dataview is a library for reading data from Mega Man Battle Network games. Namely, it can read both assets from ROMs and also save data, with some support for editing.

Unlike Tango, tango-dataview is licensed under the terms of the LGPL.

tango-dataview only works correctly on little endian systems. Don't try this on SPARC, kids!
